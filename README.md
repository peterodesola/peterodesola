## 🚀 About Me 
I am an AI and Data Science professional focused on data analysis, data analytics, machine learning, and ethical AI for healthcare and social impact. My work centres on transforming complex health and inequality datasets into actionable insights, predictive models, and interactive applications. I have research experience in uncertainty-aware healthcare machine learning, including heart disease risk prediction and AI-driven clinical decision support for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS). Through applied analytics, reproducible workflows, and clear data storytelling, I aim to build responsible, inclusive data solutions that support better decision-making in public health and beyond

When I'm not working with data, I enjoy reading, playing piano, watching and playing football. I also enjoy playing chess and scrabble. I love the "aha!" moment when data reveals something new and useful.
